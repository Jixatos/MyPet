# MyPet

## About the Project

MyPet is a mini-game inspired by the **Tamagotchi** concept, where the player can adopt, take care of, and interact with a virtual pet based on PokÃ©mon. The goal is to keep the pet happy, feed it, play with it, and ensure it gets enough rest. The game features an interactive flow where the player can view their pets, choose one, and interact to take care of the virtual pet.

## What is a Tamagotchi?

Tamagotchi is an electronic toy created in the 90s, where the player must take care of a virtual pet by ensuring its nutrition, hygiene, happiness, and rest. If the pet is neglected, it may become sad or even "die." MyPet aims to recreate this experience with a special twist by incorporating PokÃ©mon as the virtual pets in the game.

## Project Architecture

The project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern and uses **Dependency Injection** to manage interactions between system components.

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** This structure helps separate business logic (Model), user interface (View), and interaction control (Controller), making the project more organized and easier to maintain.
- **Dependency Injection:** Used to decouple system components, facilitating testing and maintenance.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized as follows:
